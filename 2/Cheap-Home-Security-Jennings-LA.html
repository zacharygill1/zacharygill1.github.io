<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports multiple users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other people are home.</p>
