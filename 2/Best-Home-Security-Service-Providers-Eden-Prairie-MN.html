<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, the majority of alarm systems work the exact same way. They utilize open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which means if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If somebody were to unlock that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which implies when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>

If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 standard and is eligible for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
