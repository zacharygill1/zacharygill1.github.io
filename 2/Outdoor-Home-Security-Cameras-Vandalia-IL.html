<p>Arlo constructs excellent home security cameras, and this third-generation Arlo Pro is a prime example of what this company is capable of.

And it can be deployed indoors or out. The Brinks Home Security system is available in 2 package alternatives. The Home Complete design is $29 monthly.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
