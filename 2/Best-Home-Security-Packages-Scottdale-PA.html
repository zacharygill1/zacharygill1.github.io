<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that appears to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup understood to male. Here's how it plays out: First you need to download the app and put in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi information of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, dogs groan, felines scream, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first ten seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>

Often, they also get in touch with your smartphone so you can stream live whatever that's going on in the house, any place you are in the internet-connected world.</p>
<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stand apart excessive. Pretty easy to install.

For instance, you can have a wise plug turn on a lamp inside or trigger an external siren when the camera spots motion.</p>
