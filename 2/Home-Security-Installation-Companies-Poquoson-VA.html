<h3>Wireless Home Security Camera Systems in Virginia</h3>
<p>Many full-time" citizens with alarm tell us that they are home all the time" and question why they would need monitoring. However, people need to consider the frequency and period of their absences from home or business - rather than simply their occupancy. Who is home, when they are not? Who will react and hear to the alarm? And so on. Less than half the protection the customer anticipates is being offered if that system is not monitored.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and room appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers recognize that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
