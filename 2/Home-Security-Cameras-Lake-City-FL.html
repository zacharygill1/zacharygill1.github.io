<p>Sensors permit cameras to start and stop tape-recording based upon time or motion detection. The one time where lag does end up being a bit of a problem is in between finding and taping movement. It takes a 2nd for the camera to really turn on when it detects motion because the Pro 2 does not do constant video recording.

<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

Digital video makers declare that turning CCTV installations into digital video setups is inherently much better).</p>
<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to resolve information after the truth, which suggests that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of tape-recording storage area.
