<p>I apologize to all the Wink fans out there, however to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is truly simply a great name for a set that includes a Wink smart home center and a few security oriented sensors. You can't deactivate the system and arm. Rather, you turn alerts on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a regular self-monitored system can do like activate a camera to record or activate the siren. Read our review here.</p>

<p>We do not hide equipment charges by rolling them into a high regular monthly rate. At Smith Thompson Security we believe the right thing to do is, is to reveal you the rate of the equipment and monitoring rate separately. That way you REALLY understand what you're investing.
