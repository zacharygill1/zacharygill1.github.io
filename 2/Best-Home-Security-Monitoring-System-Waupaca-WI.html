<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for one of our top areas. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings.
