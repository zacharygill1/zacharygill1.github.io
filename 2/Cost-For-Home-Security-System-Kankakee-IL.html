<p>Developing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the responsibility of the whole community. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a number of factors: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video you mean to keep and how long you prepare to keep recorded footage.
