<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, because it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.
