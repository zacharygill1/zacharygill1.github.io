<p>Honeywell's DIY security system counts on a gadget called the Camera Base Station. It's an Amazon Echo-like device with a camera on top. It serves as the brains of the system, getting in touch with sensors and 3rd party-devices via Z-Wave and managing them using the app or voice control. Another location where Arlo stands out is customer care.
