<p>We required guards for our annual Coats for the Cold event to secure the line tent and structure, keep order in the wee hours of the morning and to begin the heating unit at 5am. The very first guard showed up early so he could look at the entire area and talk with me about my concerns. He was professional, polite and really reassuring. The second guard got here in the middle of the night and took over. When I got here in the morning to get the occasion started, he was also expert, considerate and encouraging. We were really pleased with your service and I will suggest that we contact your company next year for this occasion. Thank you, Dennis and Henry, for a good night's sleep. I didn't fret once after leaving our property in your hands.</p>
