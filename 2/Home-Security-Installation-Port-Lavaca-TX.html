This is not the case as wireless cameras might still need a power cord. Wired security cameras are connected to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router. Lastly, wire-free cameras are entirely cable complimentary and battery powered. Although battery replacements are necessary, these are the easiest alternative to install and all of the tape-recorded video is kept in the cloud.</p>
