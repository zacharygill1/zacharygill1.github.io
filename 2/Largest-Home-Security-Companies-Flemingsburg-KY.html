But that doesn't imply you can't utilize analog cameras in an IP-based surveillance environment. Utilizing IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>
