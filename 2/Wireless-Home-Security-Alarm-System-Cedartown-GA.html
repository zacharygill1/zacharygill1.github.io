<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also good metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
