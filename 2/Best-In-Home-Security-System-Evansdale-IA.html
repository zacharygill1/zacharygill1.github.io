During testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren rapidly activating when motion was detected. We like that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your home, which can get expensive. It's also worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
