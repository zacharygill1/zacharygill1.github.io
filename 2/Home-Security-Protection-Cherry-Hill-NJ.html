<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely like it. Excellent clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone however had a couple concerns that the tech answered with ease. I Would absolutely purchase from cctvsecuritypros again. I highly suggest this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter signals, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 per month ($50 each year) for the first camera for 5 days of video history, $10 each month ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 each year) for 1 month of video history.

<p>How long does it usually take to flip to your alarm monitoring service? I use VOIP today. May relocate to cellular at some point in the future but sticking with dial-up for now. Of course, you may wish to think of purchasing a security camera or 2 to accompany your system, but going with the five-piece Ring Alarm set plus a Video Doorbell 2 (around $400 total) is a little bit more expensive than Frontpoint's most basic package for $320 (or $255 with the 20% advertising deal), which does not include a camera.</p>
