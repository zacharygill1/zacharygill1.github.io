<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their expandability, portability and impermanence. Occupants, unlike house owners, generally avoid making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other elements can quickly be set up at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new components too.
