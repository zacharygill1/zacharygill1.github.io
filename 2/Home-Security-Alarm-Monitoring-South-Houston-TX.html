<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
