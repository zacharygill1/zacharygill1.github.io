<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or home is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first question you have to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a number of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you mean to keep and the length of time you plan to keep taped video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to consume storage area rapidly.
