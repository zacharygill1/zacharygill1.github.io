<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also nice metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
