<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter occasion alerts just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals whenever you walk by.
