<p>Some wireless home security systems provide a video recording storage choice and others don't. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home any time you access your system; however, absolutely nothing is taped. The systems with video storage typically consist of either a local storage or cloud storage alternative. A local storage alternative conserves a pre-determined number of video clips on the device itself. This alternative is usually cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud. Nevertheless, this is normally a paid service and the number of hours it will store will depend upon just how much cloud storage you want to pay for.</p>
