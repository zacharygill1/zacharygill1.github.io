<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
