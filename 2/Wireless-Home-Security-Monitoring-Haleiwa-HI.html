<p>As soon as all linked together, if someone opens a window or door, or walks past a sensing unit, you will get an alert on your phone.

Some systems can then sound an alarm or contact the emergency services, and numerous likewise allow you to talk through the camera. The latter is ideal if you're stating hi to the kids who've just got back from school, or for shouting at the dog to leave the sofa.</p>
