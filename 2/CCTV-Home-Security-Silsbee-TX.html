<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
