Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
<p>Good picture and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stick out excessive. Pretty simple to install. I also like that I can download the app in my android phone and see my cameras from away from the house. The second important thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a surprisingly ear-piercing built-in alarm, so it works as a home alarm along with a security camera.
