<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider area and for that reason uses fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
