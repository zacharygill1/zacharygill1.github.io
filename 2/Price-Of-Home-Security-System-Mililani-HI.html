<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute substantially to police ability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  method to break-in reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
<p>If you have a larger home or home you want to watch on, SimpliSafe may be too minimal for you.
