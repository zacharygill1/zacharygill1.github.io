<p>CR's take: The Wyze Cam V2 is a great security camera and a phenomenal worth. It gets an Exceptional rating for video quality and is easier to use than the other cameras on this list. It also succeeds in our privacy and security tests. The camera includes a rolling 14 days of totally free storage for motion-trigged video, individual detection, voice control through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, and the ability to store footage locally on an SD card.
