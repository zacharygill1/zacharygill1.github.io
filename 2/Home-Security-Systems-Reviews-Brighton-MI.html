<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
