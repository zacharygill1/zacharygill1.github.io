You do not want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he alerts, "people may find out to be mindful about the regulars and books they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members."
