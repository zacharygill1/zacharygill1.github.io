<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle however extensive modifications to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or conscious they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "people may find out to be mindful about the books and periodicals they check out in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may likewise put more believed into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>

<p>Another important topic to go over is camera resolution. It can be puzzling to understand just how much is enough.

The very same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much photo information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
