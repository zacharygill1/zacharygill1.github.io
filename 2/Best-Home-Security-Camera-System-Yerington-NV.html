<p>Thanks to current advancements in innovation, wireless security systems are now as reliable as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you must consider the following benefits of wireless technology. The $260 Essentials package includes the base station, a keypad, four entry sensing units, one motion sensor, a yard indication, and 2 window decals. For $15 each month, you can include 24/7 professional monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline. The $25-per-month Interactive strategy includes control through iOS and Android smartphone apps, push and email notifies, and 30-day event-footage storage for endless cameras, including the SimpliSafe Video Doorbell Pro, which is readily available individually. Without the $25 strategy, you manage all controls via the keypad.</p>
