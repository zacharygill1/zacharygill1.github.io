House owners can select from indoor or outdoor security cameras that can record footage when an alarm is activated, video doorbell cameras, spotlight cameras, baby-sitter cameras, and more. All of these cameras can be integrated into the overall system so the home can be monitored by video from anywhere. To understand how home wireless security systems work, some basic understanding of alarm is valuable.
