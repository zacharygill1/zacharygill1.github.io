<p>DITEK's burglar alarm surge protectors protect your security system versus short-term rises that can get in through A/C power lines, telephone lines and remote alert zones. Home automation is convenient and easy, and wireless systems help you automate your home that much easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home devices are by their very nature wireless, and a lot of home security companies provide a home automation package with an app to remotely manage whatever on the system.

<p>Cross-zoning is a method that does not require a new keypad. Using multiple sensors to monitor activity in one area, software application analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the consumer. A second alarm signal-- gotten in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor needs to request a dispatch immediately. This integrates in increased protection and a fail safe should a door blow open or a bird rattle an outside window.</p>
