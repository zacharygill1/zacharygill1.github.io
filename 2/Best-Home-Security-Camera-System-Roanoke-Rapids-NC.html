<p>The real reason cameras are usually released is to decrease much pettier criminal offenses. But it has not even been demonstrated that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been extensively deployed in public places, sociologists studying the issue have actually found that they have not minimized criminal activity. "Once the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the basic down trend in criminal activities and offences," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were noted in specific categories but there was no proof to recommend that the cameras had decreased criminal offense overall in the city centre."
