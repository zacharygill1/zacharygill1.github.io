The Netatmo Invite does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget plan camera.</p>
