You and almost 8 million clients around the country know you can rely on ADT monitoring to help safeguard your home. Push-button Control: Instead of using the keypad to deactivate your alarm, some systems feature a push-button control.

We truly enjoyed using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier plan includes an HD video doorbell for good procedure.</p>
