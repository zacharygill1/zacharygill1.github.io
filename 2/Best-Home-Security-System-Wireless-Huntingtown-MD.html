<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential feature. Likewise nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you walk by.
