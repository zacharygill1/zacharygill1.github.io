<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
