As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
