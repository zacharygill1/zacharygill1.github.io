<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Tip: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we must again respond to the alarm; each action is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one method of removing pricey incorrect alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly switch off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to scare away potential robbers.</p>
