As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the entrance and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late considering that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
