<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
