<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a standard IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader area and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this suggests, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This means the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far bigger space and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
