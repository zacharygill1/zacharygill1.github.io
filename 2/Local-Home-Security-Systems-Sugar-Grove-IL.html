<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal activity prevention designed to avoid both individual and property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize criminal offense and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

The system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
