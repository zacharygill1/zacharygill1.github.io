<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense prevention created to prevent both individual and property crime and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize crime and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and convert them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then relayed over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be established to interact by means of network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
