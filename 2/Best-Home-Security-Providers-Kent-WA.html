<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
