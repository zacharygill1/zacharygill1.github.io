The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
