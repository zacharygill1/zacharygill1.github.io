<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 delivers free advantages like person detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage begins at $5 monthly.) However, in our tests the familiar-face alerts worked just about half of the time and the camera consistently disconnected from the network multiple times a day (when whatever else on our network seemed fine).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally regular given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
