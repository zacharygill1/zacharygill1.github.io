<p>Unlike most other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid alerts every time you stroll by.
