<p>Do you own your alarm equipment? Another reason to read your existing alarm arrangement carefully.

<p>Depending on the brand and design alarm control panel you own there may be a back door" into your panel's Program Mode if the Installer Code is not known.

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
