Then, you need to make that call yourself. It's a huge difference, and a professionally monitored system is fundamentally more secure than a self-monitored or unmonitored one.</p>

Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we typically discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
