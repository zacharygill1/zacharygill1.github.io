<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, accommodating sophisticated smart home aficionados or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
