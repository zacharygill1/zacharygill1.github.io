<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one major advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to resolve information after the truth, which suggests that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it likewise brings with it some disadvantages. 4K images are huge and use up a great deal of taping storage space. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape-record the exact same length of video footage. If extended video storage is crucial, be prepared to spend more cash.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
