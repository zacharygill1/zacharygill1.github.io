<p>Many security cameras can be used both inside and outdoors. They typically have the exact same functions like night vision or remote viewing, but they differ in sturdiness. Outdoor cameras must be weather resistant and sometimes, completely waterproof. Cameras with an IP66 or IP67 weather resistance score are the most long lasting. Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices due to the fact that their design allows for minimum glare.

Because frequently times the motion detection is set off by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by, this will offer more precise and less frequent notifies.</p>
