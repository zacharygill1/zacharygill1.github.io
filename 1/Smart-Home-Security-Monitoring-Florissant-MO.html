<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of recording video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once clients realize that the economical consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
