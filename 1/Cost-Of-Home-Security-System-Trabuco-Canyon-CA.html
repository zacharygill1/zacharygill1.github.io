<p>Depending on the size, these can be anywhere from a rifle bullet or a lipstick tube to a bread loaf, however the basic gist is the exact same in every case.

ADT uses superior brand name recognition (a powerful criminal offense deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint uses a high-support choice for those who desire a structured, Do It Yourself system.</p>

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
