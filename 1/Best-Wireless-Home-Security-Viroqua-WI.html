<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
