<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
