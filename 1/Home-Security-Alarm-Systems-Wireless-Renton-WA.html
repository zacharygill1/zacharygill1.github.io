<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
