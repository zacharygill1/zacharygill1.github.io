<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally typical considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the low-cost customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's normally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
