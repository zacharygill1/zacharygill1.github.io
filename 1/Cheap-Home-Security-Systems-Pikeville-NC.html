<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
