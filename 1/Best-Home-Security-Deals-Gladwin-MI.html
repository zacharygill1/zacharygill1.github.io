<p>GO2 supplies full-service Video Surveillance Installation of high definition (HD), IP, digital, outdoor, and wireless Security Camera Systems. Obviously, the apparent downside to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be costly. If the system was not installed throughout the homebuilding process, setting one up may need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, covering drywall and getting to hard spots that are sealed off in basements or attics. Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power blackouts. Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in the event of a failure, however long term blackouts will lead to the system losing power. When picking a wired system, it's likewise important to think about how long you plan to remain at the very same home. Since these security systems are integrated into the home's circuitry, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>
