<p>CCTV surveillance is grounded in the criminology theory that recommends prospective transgressors are less most likely to commit criminal offense if they believe they are being enjoyed or have a greater risk of being collared. This is also called the rational option theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is also grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance method, which argues that opportunities to upset can be lowered by changing a range of mechanisms such as increasing the threat of a culprit being captured, increasing the effort to commit the crime, decreasing rewards from crime commission, and minimizing justifications that generate criminal opportunities (La Vigne et al. 2011).
