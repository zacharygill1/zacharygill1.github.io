We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is developed by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false notifies). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have actually been activated.

The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
