<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a malicious attacker, because the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of information and really indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being transferred. The typical reason for performing a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, offering a chance for the destructive aggressor to record these codes and utilize various cracking tools to analyze security weaknesses and exploit them to acquire unauthorized access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can introduce a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security crucial captured during the network recovery.</p>
