Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The answer hinges on a number of elements: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to keep and the length of time you prepare to keep taped video footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video is going to consume storage space rapidly.
