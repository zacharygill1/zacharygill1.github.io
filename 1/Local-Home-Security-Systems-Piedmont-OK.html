<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of an overall security bundle, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must carry a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer thefts throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to police ability to apprehend robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by police and entire communities (all taxpayers support authorities reaction to alarmed homes) a expensive and ineffective  approach to theft decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
