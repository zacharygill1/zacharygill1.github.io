<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely regular since the doorway and space seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers understand that the economical customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late since the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that 1080p is typically the standard resolution for cameras we have actually checked, there are advantages to designs with higher-resolution sensors. Couple of home security cameras have optical zoom lenses, but practically all have digital zoom, which crop and enlarge whatever the camera is taping. The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still be able to see things clearly.</p>
