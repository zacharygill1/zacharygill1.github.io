For longer access to video, expect to pay a monthly storage fee.</p>

Nest's Secure has the best design of any system I checked, consisting of creative things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system. But the Secure is expensive, additional sensors are expensive, and the monitoring service-- which doesn't include fire alarms or camera backups-- is likewise expensive if you don't commit to a three-year agreement.</p>
