<p>3 huge benefits of wireless security systems for occupants are their portability, impermanence and expandability. Tenants, unlike homeowners, generally avoid making irreversible changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't practical; they include drilling into walls and installing permanent electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can easily be established at different residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new components too.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, typically described as shock sensors, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and often through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies produced are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>
