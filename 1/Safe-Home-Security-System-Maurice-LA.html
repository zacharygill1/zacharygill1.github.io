<p>Though most of our attention these days is concentrated on the shift to IP video innovation, it is very important to keep in mind that analog CCTV security cameras can still be highly effective for numerous surveillance applications, specifically those on a budget. With conventional CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local viewing from one main monitoring location.

Using IP video encoders and other equipment such as digital video recorders and hybrid DVRs makes it possible to leverage your existing analog cameras while moving into the world of digital surveillance.</p>

Techniques included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV assessment study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV evaluations, and calling leading scientists to inquire about upcoming evaluations. Both published and unpublished reports were consisted of in the search, which was not restricted to the English language and was worldwide in scope.</p>
