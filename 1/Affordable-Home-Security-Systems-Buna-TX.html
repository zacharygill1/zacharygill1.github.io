<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
