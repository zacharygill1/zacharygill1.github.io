Disk drive storage is safe, secure, and convenient, with lots of systems offering expansion and complimentary cloud storage, such as Arlo Pro 2 Wireless Home Security System. Where does the video feed go? Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand get rid of to move the information? Does it go to your mobile phone, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the greatest security, you want the data to be supported in numerous locations.
