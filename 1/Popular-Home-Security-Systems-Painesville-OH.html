Incorrect alarms are understood to be more typical with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the police if they occur frequently enough. Another prospective drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each piece of equipment need to be replaced or charged routinely in order to keep the system working.
