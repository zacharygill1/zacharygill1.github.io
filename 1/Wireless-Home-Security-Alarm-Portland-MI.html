<p>Everybody we handled at NSS were very valuable and accommodating. The services they provided were exactly what we desired, and they performed with professionalism and competence. I'm uncertain if any consumer-grade outdoor camera carries out all that well when it's foggy or raining, specifically during the night when weather conditions actually mess with the night vision. Still, you're right about the Arlo Pro refraining from doing anything to keep rain from striking the lens cover.</p>

Arlo states that the system utilizes 3 layers of file encryption, with restricted Web gain access to on the Base Station and no local access on the camera or the Base Station.
