<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
