<h3>Apartment Security System Chatsworth CA 91311</h3>
<p>We do not hide equipment charges by rolling them into a high monthly rate. At Smith Thompson Security our company believe the best thing to do is, is to reveal you the price of the equipment and monitoring rate independently. That method you REALLY know what you're spending. Even if you take advantage of our 12 months same as money financing option, when it's paid off, all you have left is our low monthly monitoring rate.

When the cameras were hooked up, we monitored day and night activities, consisting of the comings and goings of two adults, one kid, and a pet dog.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
