Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

The one major benefit of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the truth, which indicates that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some benefits, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are very large and take up a lot of recording storage space.
