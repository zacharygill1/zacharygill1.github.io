That means the camera will wait 5 minutes before it's able to tape again, which means you might be missing out on a lot. Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 each month per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not great-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing.

Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
