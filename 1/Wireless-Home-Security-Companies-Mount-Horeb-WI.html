<p>We don't recommend the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it should be. Recordings, signals, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for thirty days. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>The 720p camera offers a 172-degree view and color night vision. You can keep the videos on the base system instead of the cloud. The integrated MicroSD card can save around 9 hours of video on a 4 GB card.
