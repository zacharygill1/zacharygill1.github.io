<p>Another important topic to discuss is camera resolution. It can be confusing to understand just how much is enough.

Surveillance cameras are likewise made in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it concerns surveillance cameras, there are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not always much better.</p>
