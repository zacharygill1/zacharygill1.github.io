Depending on the lens' field of view, it can see between 100 and 180 degrees. That's a huge variety in terms of the camera's vision cone. You should consider a camera with a really broad field of view if you want to see a large location. The capability to mechanically tilt the camera and pan is a great asset as well.</p>
