<p>Smart Sensors - Noise an alarm whenever protected windows and doors are opened and can also be utilized to secure medicine cabinets, weapon cabinets, or the door to a child's bed room. Night vision: Many break-ins happen after dark, so this feature is almost as essential as motion detection. Technically, most home security cameras support infrared LED lighting, versus true night vision based on image intensification or thermal vision.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>

Another factor to consider with wireless home security systems is the limited variety of sensing units. Most radio frequencies are weak outside a range of 500 feet.

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals whenever you stroll by. Strangely, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
