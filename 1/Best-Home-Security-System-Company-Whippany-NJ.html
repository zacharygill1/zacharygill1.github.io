<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
