A separate network using classification 5 wiring can be utilized if bandwidth is an issue. In any case, video details is recorded on a server, which indicates video information can be located on site or in a remote area. After screening, we sent each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Cam v2, to Bill McKinley, head of details security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's moms and dad company), for hack screening.

After we utilized the Anker EufyCam for nearly six months, we're stunned to report that it is on track to provide on its promise of as much as one year of battery life.
