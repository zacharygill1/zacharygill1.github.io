<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter occasion notices just by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent notifies whenever you stroll by.
