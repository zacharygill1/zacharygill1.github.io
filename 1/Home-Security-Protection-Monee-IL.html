<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
