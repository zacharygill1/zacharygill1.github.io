<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial feature. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get proper mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a much better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly recommend.</p>
