<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal offense prevention developed to prevent both individual and home criminal activity and can be used in place of, or in addition to, cops. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance offered by CCTV will reduce crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other nearby locations where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

<p>Three big benefits of wireless security systems for tenants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Occupants, unlike homeowners, normally prevent making permanent changes to their homes. Hardwired security systems for that reason aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and setting up permanent electrical circuits. On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at various residential or commercial properties in the future, and wireless systems are quickly broadened with new elements too.
