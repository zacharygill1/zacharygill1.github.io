<p>Discover how to design, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase employee safety and reduce criminal activity. The Ring Floodlight Camera integrates two necessary gadgets in one: A home security camera and a motion-activated floodlight. When the Floodlight camera finds movement, it switches on its 2 effective LED beams as well as its sharp 1080p camera, and starts recording. The Floodlight Webcam likewise has a loud speaker, so you can talk with whoever's in front of the camera, and hear their actions.
