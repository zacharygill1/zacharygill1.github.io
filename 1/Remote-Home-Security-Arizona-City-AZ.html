<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the manufacturer's stats given that this comes from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the biggest culprit for short battery life without a doubt.

<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use also (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you wish to enter into its cleverest customisations, there is a little bit of a learning curve.
