<p>You would be hard-pressed to tell the difference between 1080p and 4K resolution when taking a look at a typical camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with information after the reality, which indicates that users can focus on information such as faces while the recording of a security occasion plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and take up a great deal of tape-recording storage space. A lot, in reality, that they need about 4 times the hard disk drive area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage. Be prepared to invest more money if extended video storage is necessary.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
