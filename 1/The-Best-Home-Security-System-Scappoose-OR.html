The alarm doesn't include a wifi security camera however you can buy a variety of various Yale cameras that will work with the alarm as optional extras.

Here is what this suggests, by way of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
