We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll require several Minuts throughout your property, which can get pricey. It's also worth noting that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
