<p>Fortunately, technological advances have actually made security systems more reputable than a brass bell and a magnet, and way more secure than moving a big rock in front of your door however we ought to bear in mind how much we owe to the innovators that have made households around the globe more secure than ever previously. When you add a security camera to your home security system, it provides you a peek into what's going on at home. If something activates your alarm, you can check your cameras to see what set it off.
