<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the same network, normally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

<h3>House Alarm Monitoring in San Diego CA</h3>
