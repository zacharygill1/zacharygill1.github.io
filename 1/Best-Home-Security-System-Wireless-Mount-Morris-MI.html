Nevertheless, to conserve that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Also, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way communication, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas.
